            <h1 style="color: red;">Summary</h1>
            Summary
            Mana Takamiya reported that Kurumi Tokisaki is the most dangerous Spirit ever known. She has killed over
            10,000 people, with an estimate of only around 100 being Spacequake victims. As such, her title as the Worst
            Spirit comes from personally killing her victims with her own hands. <br>

            Kurumi Tokisaki had used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shido Itsuka's high
            school and classroom so that she could get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons for moving were simple:
            consume Shido Itsuka, and in doing so, gain the Reiryoku sealed within his body. During the time Kurumi was
            a Raizen high school student, she almost succeeded in consuming Shido. However, she was forced to retreat
            after being overwhelmed by Kotori Itsuka's destructive power. Kurumi had claimed that it was because she
            simply wasn't prepared to face her, but later argued that she could defeat Kotori if she had more time
            stored up. <br>

            Later, it was revealed (at the end of Volume 4) that Kurumi had a conversation with a mysterious being that
            made it seemed like she was talking to herself. Here, she stated her real goal was to seek Shido out in
            order to be able to use her 12th bullet to travel 30 years back in time and kill the First Spirit. To
            accomplish that, she required a significant amount of Reiryoku which she didn't possess, which is why she
            wanted to consume Shido. Shido held the Reiryoku of three Spirits within him, enough for her to be able to
            use the 12th bullet and still have some power left over to kill the First Spirit. <br>
