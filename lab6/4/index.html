            <h2>Kurumi Tokisaki</h2>
            <div class="about">
                <p><strong>Kurumi Tokisaki</strong> (狂くる三み, Tokisaki Kurumi?) is the third Spirit to appear. Due to her
                    brutal
                    actions, she is referred to as the Worst Spirit (最悪の精霊, Saiaku no Seirei?). She is also the first
                    Spirit to appear as an antagonist in the Date A Live series. <br><br>
                    Mana Takamiya reported that Kurumi Tokisaki is the most dangerous Spirit ever known. She has killed
                    over 10,000 people, with an estimate of only around 100 being Spacequake victims. As such, her title
                    as the Worst Spirit comes from personally killing her victims with her own hands. <br><br>

                    Kurumi Tokisaki had used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shido Itsuka's
                    high school and classroom so that she could get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons for moving
                    were simple: consume Shido Itsuka, and in doing so, gain the Reiryoku sealed within his body. During
                    the time Kurumi was a Raizen high school student, she almost succeeded in consuming Shido. However,
                    she was forced to retreat after being overwhelmed by Kotori Itsuka's destructive power. Kurumi had
                    claimed that it was because she simply wasn't prepared to face her, but later argued that she could
                    defeat Kotori if she had more time stored up.
